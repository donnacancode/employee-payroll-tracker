# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description
This form allows the user to easily enter an employee's first name, last name, and salary.  The user can pull the average salary from the data entered, and further, can pull a random employee from the data entered.  

## Getting Started
This is a simple application that only requires the typed entry of an employee's first name, last name, and salary.  Once an employee has these three pieces of data in the system, the user is prompted to enter additional employees.  The user can continue to enter employees until there are no more to add.
